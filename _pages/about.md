 I’m a PhD student in computer science at the University of Washington, studying natural language processing and advised by [Noah Smith](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nasmith/) as part of [Noah’s Ark](http://www.ark.cs.washington.edu/).

 My work focuses on multilingual NLP: learning how to do NLP in languages other than English and developing methods that generalize across many languages. I’m particularly interested in ways to use knowledge from one language to improve our understanding of another. Some projects include methods for producing multilingual word vectors, neural language identification, and multilingual semantic role labeling.

 Before starting my PhD I studied computer science and cognitive science at UC Berkeley and did undergraduate research with Pieter Abbeel.
